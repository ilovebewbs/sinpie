# SINPIE - LEWD CONTENT FOR YOUR LEWD NEEDS

**MOTIVATION**

I wanted to post something to npm and learn about modules and packages and all that stuff, plus i loooooove discord embeds so much and always loved automating sending them using scripting so i decided ok let's make something nasty and ofc educational 

--- 

**CURRENT FEATURES**

CUrrently the library can do the following :

- retrieve links to boobs images from reddit where you can specifiy how many posts you want
- retrieve a random tiddy pic
- send a discord embed to your server via webhooks with a tiddy pic alongisde the title and some other stuff related to the package

---

**INSTALLATION AND USAGE**

To inatall it just use npm 

`npm install sinpie`


Then to actually use just declare an object of a class like 

```
import Boobs from "sinpie/src/boobs/Boobs.js";

const tiddy = new Boobs();

// returns a promise
tiddy.top_boobs(5).then(data => console.loh(data)).catch(e => console.error(e));

```
